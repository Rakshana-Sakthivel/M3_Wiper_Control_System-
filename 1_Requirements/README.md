# Introduction
These days, even non-luxury compact and family cars are available with rain-sensing wipers. These systems utilize an LED sensor, fitted between the windshield and rearview mirror, to detect the amount of rain or snow falling on the windshield.There are a number of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a central photodiode which make up the “rain sense” portion of the system.The invisible light emitted by the LEDs is reflected by the windshield onto the photo sensor. Therefore the more moisture there is on the windshield, the less light the sensor receives. This information is subsequently relayed to a computer control unit, which then adjusts the intermittent wiper delay intervals of the accordingly.The wetter it gets, the faster the rain sensing wipers work to help give you a clear view of what's in front of you. When the system senses drier conditions, such as when the vehicle is stopped at a red light and the rain is falling less intensely, the wipers will gradually slow down before switching themselves off when no longer needed.
# Objectives
The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile rain wiper automatically without driver interaction. The system is developed to mitigate driving distractions and allow drivers to focus on their primary task of driving. The distraction eliminated with the development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers when driving in precipitation. The few seconds that a driver takes their attention off the road to adjust a knob while driving in poor weather conditions could potentially lead to car accidents.The system uses a combination of impedance and rain sensor to detect rain and its intensity. The system contains a controller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the operation of the windshield wipers based on those input signals The aim of this project is to help reduce accidents that happen as a result of the driver intending to clean the windscreen when rain is falling thereby taking the attention of the driver off the road when he or she is switching on and off the wiper. In rainy days we suffer from the act of sprinkling of water on the front glass of our wheeler. While driving, when drivers cannot see visibly on-road vehicles they try operating the wiper on glass manually, at times switching on and off intermittently and this distraction might cause vehicle accident. If we apply any kind of sensor on glass which senses the act of sprinkling water, by automation, the wiper will be operating automatically. When the water hit the sensor, it will send a signal to the system thus triggering the wiper motor. Once the sensor does not detect any water, the wiper will stop. This will reduce the human interface that has been stated earlier. An addition to this invention is that the wiper automatically push up from the windscreen when the engine is shut off.
# Features
A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor (30) detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions.
# Swot Analysis
# Strength
1) Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor. Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.
2) It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption.
3) It extends life of rain sensor based systems such as car wiper, irrigation systems by running them only when it is necessary.
4) Rain sensors help save water during rain events and hence water is available during summer and emergency applications such as firefighting etc.
5) Operating principle is very easy.
6) It consumes less power for operation.
7) Installation of rain sensor based systems are very much simple.
8) Individual rain sensor costs very less.
# Weakness
1) The rain sensor based system functions when water falls on the sensor directly.
2) The cost of overall system increases as additional components are needed along with rain sensor.
3) In order to avoid false detection of rain, it requires rain sensors to take decision after few minutes.
# Opportunities 
Windshield wipers keep the windshield of a vehicle clear from rain water, snow, dust and road spray. The first windshield wipers were operated manually by moving a lever inside the car. Later wiper designs were powered by the engine's manifold vacuum. 
# Threats 
# Wipers are frozen or snowed on to the windshield 
Your windshield wipers don't weight very much so its easy for heavy wet snow to weight them down or cause them to freeze onto the windshield. 
# Wipers aren't fastened in properly 
If you don't put your windshield wiper blades on properly, they won't be able to function. 
# Wipers have torn blades 
Your windshield wiper blades are made of rubber that's meant to handle water and sometimes ice. Faced with anything solid, these rubber blades can rip easily causing your wipers not to work. Causes of Broken Windshield Wipers. 
# 4W's and 1'H 
# WHERE 
During driving in heavy rain. 
# WHEN 
Commonly used during rainy season and when there is unwanted dust in windshield. 
# WHY 
For cleaning the wind shield from unwanted dust and mist. 
# HOW 
When we on the wiper switch it gets activated. 
# Advantages 
1) Optimal wiping performance
2) Enhanced driver comfort
3) Reduced noise from wiper operation
4) Improved visibility
5) Vechicle design freedom
6) Space occupancy in plenum area significantly reduced
7) Wiper arm/blade protection - from potential sources of damage e.g. snow block.
Easy blade replacement
8) 'service' position facilitates blade replacement.

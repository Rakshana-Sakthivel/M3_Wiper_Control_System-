# Introduction
These days, even non-luxury compact and family cars are available with rain-sensing wipers. These systems utilize an LED sensor, fitted between the windshield and rearview mirror, to detect the amount of rain or snow falling on the windshield.There are a number of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a central photodiode which make up the “rain sense” portion of the system.The invisible light emitted by the LEDs is reflected by the windshield onto the photo sensor. Therefore the more moisture there is on the windshield, the less light the sensor receives. This information is subsequently relayed to a computer control unit, which then adjusts the intermittent wiper delay intervals of the accordingly.The wetter it gets, the faster the rain sensing wipers work to help give you a clear view of what's in front of you. When the system senses drier conditions, such as when the vehicle is stopped at a red light and the rain is falling less intensely, the wipers will gradually slow down before switching themselves off when no longer needed.
